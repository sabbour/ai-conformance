#### Introduction

The Certified AI Platform Marks are trademarks of The Linux Foundation (administered by CNCF). The Linux Foundation, through CNCF, has established the Conformance Program to achieve two objectives: 1) Ensure that the Certified AI Platform Marks remain reliable indicators of the scalability qualities that they have been created to preserve, and 2) Ensure that community members are able to accurately describe their Conformant Platforms.

To achieve these objectives, The Linux Foundation requires that third parties who use the Certified AI Platform Marks in association with their goods and services may do so only as Participants pursuant to the Conformance Program described in this document. By participating in the Conformance Program and by using the Certified AI Platform Marks, a Participant acknowledges that third parties will be relying on the accuracy of its submitted Conformance Checklist and evidence, and on its compliance with the terms of the Conformance Program.

#### Participant Requirements

In order to be a Participant in the Conformance Program and to use the Certified AI Platform Marks, a Participant must do the following:


1. Be a current member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
2. Identify the specific version(s) of its AI/MLOps platform ("Platform") intended to achieve conformance.
3. Ensure the specific version of the Platform is publicly available and has comprehensive public documentation accessible.
4. Complete the Conformance Checklist, providing verifiable evidence for all claims, demonstrating adherence to the scalability criteria defined by the Program.
5. submit to The Linux Foundation a signed Participation Form (by email to [conformance@cncf.io](mailto:conformance@cncf.io), by [DocuSign]() or other method made available by The Linux Foundation), designating the applicable Qualifying Offerings and Participant AI Platform Combinations and accepting the terms and conditions of the Conformance Program;
5. Submit to CNCF the completed Conformance Checklist for the specific Platform version.
6. Have the submitted Conformance Checklist reviewed and accepted (merged).
7. Pay fees (if any) required for its participation in the Conformance Program. (Note: Currently, no fees are charged for CNCF members).
8. Abide by the terms and conditions of the Conformance Program, including subsequent re-certification as described herein, throughout the period of the Participant’s use of the Certified AI Platform Marks.

#### Conformant Platforms and Conformance Process

The Certified AI Platform Marks are intended to be used with Participants’ Platforms that are Conformant Platforms. The Program Manifest and Conformance Checklist Template contain details about the conformance process and the specific scalability criteria that must be met. A Participant confirms that its Platform version is a Conformant Platform by submitting a complete and accurate Conformance Checklist with verifiable evidence, which is subsequently accepted by CNCF.

After preparing the checklist and evidence, a Participant must submit it to CNCF via Pull Request as described in the Program Manifest.

The Certified AI Platform Marks may only be used with Platform versions whose Conformance Checklist has been both submitted to and accepted (merged) by CNCF. The results (the merged checklist) will be publicly available in https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance/.

One objective of the Conformance Program is that the claims made in the Conformance Checklist should be verifiable based on the provided evidence (e.g., public documentation). If The Linux Foundation/CNCF determines or is informed that (1) evidence is inaccessible or inaccurate, or (2) the Platform demonstrably fails to meet the criteria claimed in the accepted checklist, then upon written notice from The Linux Foundation/CNCF, the Participant must address any non-conformance concerns raised; potentially resubmit evidence or an updated checklist; and have it accepted by CNCF within 30 days following such notice. Otherwise, the Participant will be subject to the requirements to remove the Certified AI Platform Marks set forth herein.

The conformance process and permission to use the Certified AI Platform Marks apply to a specific version of a Conformant Platform. If a Participant subsequently modifies a Conformant Platform in a way that materially affects its adherence to the scalability criteria, and The Linux Foundation/CNCF determines or is informed that the Platform may no longer conform, then upon written notice from The Linux Foundation/CNCF the Participant must submit an updated Conformance Checklist for the modified version and have it accepted by CNCF within 30 days following such notice. Otherwise, the Participant’s permitted usage time period for that version will be deemed expired and will be subject to the requirements to remove the Certified AI Platform Marks set forth herein.

Conformance is valid for one year from the date the Conformance Checklist PR is merged (accepted). To maintain conformance for a Platform (which may be a newer version), Participants must undergo re-certification annually by submitting a new or updated Conformance Checklist for a current, publicly available version of the Platform and having it accepted by CNCF before the previous certification expires.

After the expiration of the permitted usage time period (if the Participant does not re-certify) or other termination of participation in the Conformance Program, a Participant may no longer use the Certified AI Platform Marks in new materials associated with the non-conformant version(s), and must remove the Certified AI Platform Marks from existing marketing materials and websites referencing those non-conformant version(s) within 30 days.

#### Use of the Certified AI Platform Marks

Use of the Certified AI Platform Marks is only permitted for Participants who have satisfied the requirements of the Conformance Program; is only permitted in connection with its Conformant Platforms (specific versions); and is only permitted for the usage time periods specified above. No other rights to use the Certified AI Platform Marks are permitted hereunder, except to the extent permitted under "fair use" or other applicable law.

All use of the Certified AI Platform Marks is subject to the LF Trademark Usage Guidelines and the AI Platform Branding Guide, which are incorporated herein.

* **Do** follow the requirements set forth in the AI Platform Branding Guide when using the Certified AI Platform Marks.
* **Do** specify the version of the Platform for which conformance has been achieved, in a location near the Participant’s use of the Certified AI Platform Marks.
* **Do** include appropriate notices of The Linux Foundation’s ownership of the Certified AI Platform Marks.
* **Do not** use the Certified AI Platform Marks except as permitted pursuant to the Conformance Program’s terms. For example, do not use the Certified AI Platform Marks with a platform version that is not itself a Conformant Platform, or with a formerly Conformant Platform whose period of use has expired.
* **Do not** be misleading about the nature or scope of conformance. Do not state or imply that the Participant’s participation in the Conformance Program constitutes The Linux Foundation’s or CNCF’s endorsement of a Participant or its goods or services. For example, do not say that a Participant or a Conformant Platform has been "certified by CNCF" or "certified by The Linux Foundation," or that "The Linux Foundation has certified Product XYZ." State that the platform version has achieved CNCF AI Platform Conformance.
* **Do not** state or imply that there are different degrees of conformance beyond what is defined by the program (e.g., Profiles, if implemented). For example, do not say that a Conformant Platform is "more scalable" than another simply based on conformance status.
