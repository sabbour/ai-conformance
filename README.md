# Certified AI Platform Conformance Program

All vendors are invited to submit conformance testing results for review and certification by the CNCF.

If your company provides a platform for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based on CNCF Projects, we encourage you to get certified today.

<!-- For more information please checkout [cncf.io/cai](https://cncf.io/cai). -->

## Prepare

Learn about the [certification requirements](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance/blob/master/terms-conditions/Certified_AI_Platform.md) and technical instructions to prepare your product for certification.

## PR Submit

Please check the [instructions](https://github.com/cncf/ai-conformance/blob/master/instructions.md#contents-of-the-pr) for details about how to prepare your PR.
Also, note that any submission made to this repo will need to first pass a number of checks that are verified by the [verify conformance bot](#verify-conformance-bot-coming-soon) before its reviewed by the CNCF.

## Helpful Resources

### [Verify conformance bot](#) (Coming Soon!)

This automation provides timely feedback and reduces the time required by the CNCF to confirm that the PR meets all policy requirements. This will be based on the [Kubernetes Conformance Bot](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/verify-conformance)
